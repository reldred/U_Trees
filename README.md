# U_Trees

## reMOD?
yeah so I added a bunch of functionality to U&Tree, tropic support based roughly on like an american west, not full blown desert more a scrub kinda thing. also allows toggling each climate on and off if you wanna do some shenanigans with loading alongside/over the top of other tree sets.

you should use the tropic functionality alongside my fork of Chujo's Desert as Objects with the base set replacer set to OpenGFX2 arctic.
